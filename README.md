# 🎵 JonZON-X AY-3-8912 Sound Expansion for ZX81

JonZON-X is a modern recreation of the ZON-X-81 Sound Box by Bi-Pak, designed for the ZX81. It uses the AY-3-8912 Programmable Sound Generator (PSG) and supports stereo line-out, and historically accurate address decoding.

This project prioritizes:
- ✅ Robust signal integrity
- ✅ Accurate control logic
- ✅ Modular expansion
- ✅ Historical preservation

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Recreate the original ZON-X-81 using AY-3-8912
- Provide stereo line-out instead of onboard speaker
- Divide CPU clock as in the original design
- Support optional for A4 for ZON X compatibility
- Document logic blocks and truth tables that match the actual schematic

---

## 🧠 Control Signal Logic

JonZON-X uses modern 74HC-series gates to derive control signals for the AY-3-8912. The address decoding is based on:

- **A0–A4**: Select ZON X compatibility.
- **A0–A3**: Select ZON X-81 compatibility.
- **A7**: Used in BC1 logic
- **/IOREQ**, **/WR**, **/RD**: Control timing

### Signal Derivation

| Signal | Logic Expression | Gates Used |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| **BDIR** | Derived from /IOREQ and /WR  
→ Routed through 74HC02 (inversion) and 74HC11 (3-input AND) | 74HC02, 74HC11 |
| **BC1** | Derived from /IOREQ, /WR, A2, A7, /RD  
→ Routed through 74HC02 and 74HC11 | 74HC02, 74HC11 |

There is **no AYSEL signal**—address selection is handled directly via A0–A4 (or A5/A6 for additional PSGs).

## 📊 Truth Table

| A0–A4     0-A3 | A2 | A7 | /IOREQ | /WR | /RD | BDIR | BC1 | Operation         |
|--------------- |----|----|--------|-----|-----|------|-----|-------------------|
| PSG 1 selected | 1  | 1  | 0      | 0   | 1   | 1    | 1   | Write to register |
| PSG 1 selected | 1  | 1  | 0      | 0   | 0   | 1    | 0   | Write to PSG      |
| PSG 1 selected | 1  | 1  | 0      | 1   | 0   | 0    | 1   | Read from PSG     |
| Not selected   | —  | —  | —      | —   | —   | 0    | 0   | Inactive          |

## 🖼️ Visual Decode Logic

![AY Control Logic](Images/PSG%20Selection%20Logic.png)

This schematic snippet shows how BDIR and BC1 are generated using 74HC02 and 74HC11 gates. Address selection is handled via A0–A4 for ZON X and A0-A3 for ZON X-81.

---

## 🎚️ DIP Switch Mapping for PSG Selection

JonZON-X supports up to three AY-3-8910 PSGs using configurable address lines via DIP switches. The DIP switches control A4, A5, and A6 to select which PSG is active.

| PSG   | A4  | Address (Binary) | Address (Decimal) |
|-------|----|----|----|------------------|-------------------|
| PSG1  | 1  | 0  | 0  | `11111111`       | 255               |

- **A4** connection to the ZX81 bus is for ZON X compatibility.
- The bits are part of the PSG register select address and are high (1) for ZON X-81.
- The DIP switch overrides the default A4 line from the ZX81.

## 📅 Revision History

### 🔧 Rev 1.0 Testing Note — Stereo Jack Adaptation
- **Socket Type:** 3-pin stereo jacks used in place of shunted 5-pin variants.
- **Pad Bridging:** Inner pads manually jumped to outer signal pads; ground positioned at center front.
- **Trade-off:** Left and Right channels will be reversed — acceptable for initial validation.
- **Rationale:** Simplifies early testing without requiring shunt headers. Prioritizes proof-of-function over stereo fidelity

### 🔄 Rev 1.1 — Audio Jack Correction
- **Issue:** Left and Right channels were misrouted via Shunts A and B.
- **Fix:** Channel A and B were reversed in the schematic to compensate for the physical swap.
- **Impact:** Stereo output now matches expected channel mapping. Updated KiCad files reflect this correction.


### 🔄 Rev 1.2 – Stereo Output Mapping Adjustment

- **Issue**: Legacy ZON-X-81 software frequently routes noise to Channel B, but JonZON-X previously mixed Channel C to both outputs (a common pattern in other PSG devices, including the ZX Spectrum 128K). This caused noise effects to be isolated to the right channel or lost in stereo playback.
- **Fix**: Remapped stereo output:
  - Channel A → Left
  - Channel B → Mixed (Left + Right)
  - Channel C → Right  
  This ensures Channel B (the legacy noise channel) is centered in stereo output.
- **Impact**: Improved compatibility with original ZON-X-81 programs and demos. Noise effects now play as intended across both channels, preserving the sonic balance of legacy software.

### 🔄 Rev 1.3 – Logic Footprint Correction
- **Issue**: 74HTC Logic IC footprints where set as 400mil wide not 300mil.
- **Fix**: Change footprints:
  - Corrected 74HCT logic IC footprints from 400mil to 300mil for proper socket fit.
  - Updated KiCad symbols and PCB layout to reflect accurate DIP sizing.
- **Impact**: Improves build reliability and simplifies future revisions.

### 🔄 Rev 2.0 – Going back to my roots
- **Issue**: Rev 1.x has some major timing and stability issues, so the project was Archived and a fresh start on v2.0
- **Fix**: Going back to the simple ways:
  - Changed decoding logic back to origional ZON X and ZON X-81.
  - Reverting back to AY-3-8912 as in the origional.
  - Created new KiCad Schematic and PCB for v2.0 to test out origional logic and miss out the optional A5 and A6.
  - Make the PCB simple with no flooded ground plains to see if that was making noise and reflections.
  - Keep cleen short traces with weights set for the appropriate Nets.
  - Update truth tables to remove A5 and A6.
  - Remove DIP Switch settings and replace with a single switch for ZON X and ZON X-81 compatibility.
  - Add solder in edge connector for easier assembly.
  - Add test header points for discrete debugging without compromising trace lengths.
- **Impact**: Rev 1.x does not work.

## 📝 Notes

This is my first KiCad project and GitHub repo. While I’ve used other EDA tools and GitHub before, this is a learning curve and a preservation effort.
