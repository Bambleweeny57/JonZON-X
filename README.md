# ZON-X Recreation
My attempt at recreating the ZON-X-81 Sound Box by Bit-Pak.

This would use the AY-3-8910 rather than the AY-3-8912 due to current costs.

it will have a mixed stereo line out rather than the inbuilt speaker of the origional.

I will also divide the CPU clock as the origional did to save a clock circuit.

Various sources have been used to create the starts of this project.

if the initial revision works there may be additions to support, RAM, ROM and a Joystick Port as time permits.

This is my first attempt at a KiCad project and Github Repo, so a big learning curve, though I have used other EDA's and Github.
